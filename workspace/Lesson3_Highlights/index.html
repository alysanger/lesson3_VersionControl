            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Working in the technology realm, my company uses a source control system regularly. Doing so, allows the team members to access both a local and shared repository to complete tasks and limit the errors of multiple users on the same issue. Team members can make a change, upload the change, and continue working seamlessly and without fear that their repository holds outdated or incorrect code. Keeping a respository on your local computer allows quicker access to the information rather than waiting for a server to pull the information before being able to start work. Once complete, the shared repository can then be updated and continue to house code from multiple team members. Repositories can be used for code, documents, and other files. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Staging/Commit</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">As we just discussed repositories, it's important to mention the process that goes in to maintaining them. Before a file is uploaded to the repository, it is likely first "staged". Doing so allows the system to check for any errors or issues that may occur. If the file successfully passes this stage, it can then be committed and will soon be shared to the other team members. If a file does not pass the staging process, the user will need to resolve any discrepancies before processing their commit. Upon successfully resolving any issues with the check in, the item can then be staged successfully and committed to the repository for the next upload.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Push/Pull</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">We've successfully navigated the staging process and have committed our files to be uploaded to the shared repository, now we must complete a push and (optionally) a pull. By pushing our changes, we're prompting the system to share our work with the rest of the team and safely store it in the shared repository. A pull is also recommended to retrieve any updates other team members may have completed within the shared repository, and to ensure your repository always stays up-to-date to reduce the risk of any issues in the future. Remember, when we stage and commit, if we do not have the latest version we risk having an unsuccessful process and will need to address any issues before we can commit future changes we make.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Logs</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When multiple users are working on the same project, in the same repository, it can sometimes be helpful to know who has accomplished what. Fortunately, when working with a source control manager such as Git, doing so is a breeze. Users have the ability to look at the history Logs and see what tasks were completed, provided that users are including comments during their commits. Users will also have the ability to view the files that were modified with the latest Push/Pull, and compare files to their local version to ensure they are not duplicating work. This comes in very handy for teams that are large or small, and for the team leads to keep track of the work being completed.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Branching</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Occasionally a user may require their own version of the source, but want to continue using the benefits of a shared repository. This may happen when multiple releases are going on for the same project - for example sprints. In these cases, the team may opt to create a branch of the code that is separate from the main code. Once work has been completed, the team then has the option to merge these branches back in to the main line and continue work as usual, provided that there are not issues that must be resolved from the main version and the branched version.</p>
